The Institute for Community Inclusion (ICI) at UMass Boston supports the rights of children and adults with disabilities to participate in all aspects of society. As practitioners, researchers, and teachers, we form partnerships with individuals, families, and service agencies. We focus our work on the intersection of disability in employment, education, health care, and community life. Together we advocate for personal choice, self-determination, and social and economic justice.

 

ICI promotes the full inclusion of people with disabilities into the mainstream workforce. We provide direct employment services to individuals with disabilities. Our employment related efforts also include staff training, technical assistance, and research. We develop a wide array of tools and resources for a broad range of audiences, including practitioners, policymakers, and people with disabilities and their families.
