The Institute for Community Inclusion (ICI) at UMass Boston supports the rights of children and adults with disabilities to participate in all aspects of society. As practitioners, researchers, and teachers, we form partnerships with individuals, families, and service agencies. We focus our work on the intersection of disability in employment, education, health care, and community life. Together we advocate for personal choice, self-determination, and social and economic justice.

ICI promotes the full inclusion of people with disabilities into the mainstream workforce. We provide direct employment services to individuals with disabilities. Our employment related efforts also include staff training, technical assistance, and research. We develop a wide array of tools and resources for a broad range of audiences, including practitioners, policymakers, and people with disabilities and their families.

<h2 class="mb-3">About CCIDS</h2>

The University of Maine Center for Community Inclusion and Disability Studies (CCIDS) is Maine’s congressionally authorized University Center for Excellence in Developmental Disabilities (UCEDD). Established in 1992, the Center works closely with people with disabilities, families, state and local government agencies, community providers and others on projects providing training, technical assistance, service, research, and information sharing. There are currently 67 UCEDDs; at least one in every U.S. state and territory. FY 2023 represents CCIDS’ 31st year of continuous federal competitive core funding.

Through outreach education, training and technical assistance, CCIDS faculty and staff enhance the capacity of individuals, communities, organizations, and state systems to create services and supports for individuals with disabilities. Methods reflect current and emerging evidence-based practices that are inclusive, accessible, self-determining, culturally competent, and socially responsible, respecting the inherent abilities of each person to contribute to society.

A Community Advisory Committee (CAC) partners with CCIDS, to advise, plan and implement the activities of the Center. The CAC is comprised of a majority of individuals with developmental disabilities and family members and includes a representative of Maine’s protection and advocacy system, a representative of the Maine Developmental Disabilities Council, and a representative from a self-advocacy organization.
