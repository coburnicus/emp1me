Are you using best practices when providing employment services to individuals with disabilities? Are you sharing up-to-date information about services to individuals you case manage, their families, and other team members? Do you want to know more about proven strategies and practices in your new job? 

Join us for this training to learn about all the latest advances in supporting individuals to identify their career goals, negotiate and create job opportunities, and provide inclusive and individualized job supports. 

This process should be about, with, and for the individual. We will also discuss how to incorporate self-determination, informed choice, and dignity of risk into all aspects of your service delivery. 

 

*This training is appropriate for educators who support individuals in exploring and trying new jobs, staff who provide employment services, and case managers. Attendees will earn 3.5 professional development hours.*
