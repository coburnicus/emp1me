Presenters: Joe Zesski and Christopher Sweet, Northeast ADA Center

At the Northeast ADA Center, we often hear from individuals with mental health disabilities who are trying to sort out their rights and accommodation needs in the workplace. While we cannot advise any individual on what they should do, we can advise people on their rights under the ADA. This webinar will discuss employment rights under the ADA. This webinar may be of particular interest for individuals with disabilities, employment service providers, and all those with a general interest in this topic.
