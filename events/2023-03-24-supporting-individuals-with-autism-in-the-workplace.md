Individuals with autism bring valuable and unique assets to the workplace, yet supporting the specific and often complex needs of clients with autism can be challenging for employers. How can employment professionals and educators support the sensory, communication, social, and mental health needs of autistic job seekers while engaging their strengths in the workplace? How can practitioners ensure that job placements are well-matched to mutually benefit the preferences and needs of job seekers and employers? \

This in-depth training will include discussion of common characteristics of autism and their potential impact on employment, strategies to facilitate independence, self-management, and self-advocacy throughout the employment process, examples of practical workplace accommodations, and much more.
This training is appropriate for professionals assisting people with autism on their employment journey and provides three hours of professional development.
