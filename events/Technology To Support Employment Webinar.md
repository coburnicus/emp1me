Lunch and Learn Webinar

Supporting individuals with disabilities on the job requires creativity. Employment professionals are often looking for new and effective ways to facilitate independence, decrease reliance on support staff, and increase the use of environmental supports. What role can technology play in this process? This session provides an overview of different technology domains, information on populations that can benefit from technology, considerations for providing remote support, and technology-related resources. This webinar is appropriate for anyone providing employment services for individuals with disabilities. _Earn 1 hour of professional development and a letter of attendance._
