The family members of people with disabilities are often very involved and invested in the lives of their loved ones. This webinar will address ways to include families in the employment development process while continuing to maintain a focus on self-determination and person-centered planning. We will discuss the role that families can play in supporting individuals to meet their employment goals and the use of active listening skills to develop trusting and effective relationships with team members. We will share handouts and tools for future use in your work with families as they navigate the complicated transition and employment services systems. *This webinar is appropriate for anyone working with families and other team members to assist individuals to find and maintain jobs in the community. One hour of professional development will be provided.*

**Presenters**: Lara Enein, Institute for Community Inclusion, UMass Boston, Janet May, University of Maine, and Carrie Woodstock, Maine Parent Federation
