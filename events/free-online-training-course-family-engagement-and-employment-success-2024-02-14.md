People with disabilities often have highly involved families and caregivers in their lives. This free online course will address ways to include families in the employment development process while continuing to maintain a focus on self-determination and person-centered planning.  

 The Family Engagement and Employment Success course will be available 24/7 during the month of April so you can log on at your convenience and complete the work. The course has 2 hours’ worth of content. You will receive a letter of completion when you finish the course. You can use this letter for educator professional credits and employment staff professional development hours.  Questions about this course should be sent to lara.enein@umb.edu

 *This course is for educators, employment specialists, career planners, and job coaches who assist people with disabilities to find and maintain jobs in the community*.
