Registration is now open for the February 2025 START course. Please note, this is the final session the Office of Aging and Disability Services will be sponsoring. Direct Support Professionals and Supervisors/Managers may sign up.

The course consists of six weekly, webinar-style sessions via Zoom (105 minutes each), teaching best practices in providing positive, therapeutic interventions for people with IDD and mental health needs.
