Wondering about different strategies to engage employers and obtain jobs for individuals with disabilities? Join us for this webinar to learn more about Progressive Employment. Progressive Employment is a model that the Maine Division of Vocational Rehabilitation and Division of Blind and Visually Impaired have been using with their VR clients. The model has shown significant success in the state of Maine for youth with barriers to employment. This webinar will provide a high-level overview of the Progressive Employment model and key considerations for adoption and implementation of it. Presenters will share their respective experiences with Progressive Employment and the expansion into other states, including a new project in partnership with the Maine Bureau of Employment Services. This webinar is appropriate for anyone doing career exploration and job development activities with youth and adults with disabilities. This webinar provides one hour of professional development.
