**Are you or someone you support interested in owning your own small business based on a skill, passion, or something you are good at?**

Self-employment can offer people with disabilities flexibility and an opportunity to develop a business that is meaningful and works for them. Business ownership may also offer increased status and visibility in communities and provide an avenue to build long lasting relationships and earn a competitive wage.

The Rhode Island Developmental Disabilities Council launched a self-employment business “incubator” project in 2016 and to date the RIDDC and its partners have supported more than 140 individuals to start and grow their own business. Join the webinar to learn how entrepreneurs in Rhode Island have used their talents, skills, resources, and connections to create their ideal job or small business venture.
