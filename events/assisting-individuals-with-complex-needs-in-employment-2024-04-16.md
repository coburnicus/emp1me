Have you ever met a job seeker with complex support needs and wondered how you could help them succeed at work?  Have you felt inadequately prepared to assist someone on your caseload with feeding support needs, behavioral challenges, limited personal safety awareness, or other complexities?

 Although individuals with high support needs may present unique challenges, there are strategies you can use to ensure all job seekers have what they need to thrive in the workforce. 

 Join this free webinar to explore these strategies as well as steps you can take throughout the employment process to pave the way toward on-the-job success and satisfaction. In this webinar, we will: 

* share approaches to identifying and implementing work-related supports
* discuss the benefits of a strengths-based approach to employment
* review placement support planning
* highlight best practices through anecdotes and success stories 

 *This webinar is for professionals providing employment support for people with disabilities, including employment specialists, job coaches, counselors, and/or transition staff. Earn 1 hour of professional development for attending.*
