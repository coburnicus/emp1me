Join us for this unique, instructor-supported online training to become a Certified Employment Specialist. The courses and fieldwork are all available online 24/7 and there is no traveling required. Select "ACRE training" on the registration form.

Log in and complete the work at your convenience. There are three required scheduled webinars to enhance your learning experience and network with other professionals in the group. Instructors are available during the training to answer any of your questions and support you in completing the required work. We provide ample time to complete all the required courses through the College of Employment Services and to submit your fieldwork assignments. You can pace yourself and finish as early in the training as you would like but you must complete all the work by September 30, 2024. You will receive your ACRE certificate as soon as you complete all the work.
