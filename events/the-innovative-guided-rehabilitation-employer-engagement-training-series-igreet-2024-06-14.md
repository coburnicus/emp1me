The core components of the training are 4 modules that are offered in both for virtual classroom style and self-paced online versions. To support agency wide adoption of the principles and practices presented in the training, supplemental training and guides are available for agency leadership and trainers. *CRC continuing education credits and certificates of completion are available upon request.*  

The online, asynchronous iGREET course offers participants the opportunity to complete individual iGREET modules or the entire course within a three-month period. This is a stand-alone, self-paced course using the iGREET curriculum content and a variety of online learning modalities, including case studies, videos, text, resources, and knowledge checks.

For learners who prefer to learn through discussion and face-to-face interactions, the iGREET course (14 lessons) is offered via Zoom and is delivered classroom style. This format is great for you if you prefer to interact with your fellow participants and the trainers. Lessons are typically held once a week and attendance at all or most of the lessons is required
