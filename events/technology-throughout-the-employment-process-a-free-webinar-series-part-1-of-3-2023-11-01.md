**Technology Tools On-the-Job - Webinar #1 of 3**

Supporting individuals with disabilities on the job requires creativity. Employment professionals are often looking for new and effective ways to facilitate independence, decrease reliance on support staff, and increase the use of environmental supports. What role can technology play in this process? This session includes information on assistive technology and examples of educational and virtual meeting technology.

**Format**: 9:30–10:30am, presenters will share content related to the webinar topic. From 10:30–11:00am, facilitators will host a question-and-answer session, allowing participants to ask content-related or technical questions to the facilitators and other participants.

**Letters of Attendance:**  Will be provided for each individual webinar. Participants must be present for the first hour of the webinar to get the link to their letter of attendance. Participants do not need to remain on the webinar for the question-and-answer portion to get a letter.

Each webinar session provides 1 hour of professional development. *The webinar series is for anyone who performs job development activities and/or support to individuals at their jobsite.*
