Sometimes, people with disabilities need to decide if they will share information about their disability to an employer or prospective employer. Disclosing personal information at work or during a job search is nuanced and should be done with caution. However, sharing information about disability can help the employer understand how an employee or job seeker might do certain job tasks. Disclosing disability information might also help employers understand potential accommodations. 

Join us for this webinar to explore best practices around disclosure. Learn about disclosure-related issues to consider when supporting a job seeker to find a job that works for them. Questions about this webinar should be sent to kelly.wanzer@umb.edu
