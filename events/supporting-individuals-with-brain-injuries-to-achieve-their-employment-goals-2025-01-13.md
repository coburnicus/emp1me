Join us for a free, 1-hour webinar to explore how employment professionals can best support people recovering from brain injuries in their pursuit of employment.

Individuals navigating life after brain injury experience a range of complex symptoms and challenges throughout their recovery. They may face changes in cognition, communication, physical ability, mental status, ability to maintain relationships, and many other challenges. 

 In this webinar, you will:

learn foundational information about brain injury

understand common accommodations to support those recovering from brain injuries

learn how to support changing family dynamics during brain injury recovery

hear about clients who have successfully navigated brain injury and employment

We will share practical resources throughout the presentation.  This webinar is for employment services staff, case managers, and educators who support individuals in obtaining and maintaining competitive employment.  You can receive 1 hour of professional development for your participation.
