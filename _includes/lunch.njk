			Maine's rugged and rural landscapes are world-renowned for their pristine beauty, but the remoteness of these communities can create challenges in supporting individuals to find competitive integrated employment opportunities aligned with strengths and interests. Rural-specific barriers like transportation, sparse businesses, and a lack of service providers can create significant challenges. This session will provide participants with effective strategies to address these barriers specific to rural communities. Participants will learn how to boost rural job development by using advances in technology, creative approaches to job matching, and underused self-employment strategies.
