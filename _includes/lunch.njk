			Customized career planning is a crucial process for finding meaningful and fulfilling careers for individuals. How can employment professionals stay organized and keep stakeholders working toward the job seeker's career goals? Utilizing a 30-day placement plan is a great option. This webinar discusses the components of a 30-day placement plan, when and why to implement one, and how to keep stakeholders engaged in the process. The practical strategies shared by the presenters are immediately relevant to employment professionals and help provide structure and direction for job seekers. Sample case studies are included, and questions from participants are welcome.

			The biggest single predictor of later employment success is whether students get paid work experience before graduating. Creating and facilitating those work experiences can be difficult, though. Transition practitioners must juggle academic expectations and may not have experience approaching employers to develop job opportunities. This session will discuss evidence-based approaches for developing work-based learning experiences for students with disabilities. Participants will learn practical strategies for facilitating meaningful work experiences based on student strengths and interests. Additionally, tips for developing work opportunities by engaging with local employers will be discussed.

			Maine's rugged and rural landscapes are world-renowned for their pristine beauty, but the remoteness of these communities can create challenges in supporting individuals to find competitive integrated employment opportunities aligned with strengths and interests. Rural-specific barriers like transportation, sparse businesses, and a lack of service providers can create significant challenges. This session will provide participants with effective strategies to address these barriers specific to rural communities. Participants will learn how to boost rural job development by using advances in technology, creative approaches to job matching, and underused self-employment strategies.

			Rural communities are fundamentally different than bigger towns and cities — so, why would we try a one-size-fits-all approach to providing employment services? Maine’s rural and remote communities are among the world’s most remarkable, but they also introduce barriers to competitive integrated employment for their residents and those who support them. This session will provide participants with an in-depth opportunity to practice rural- specific strategies and techniques to overcome barriers to employment. Participants will learn how innovative and evidence-based approaches to using technology and creative job development and customization can lead to competitive integrated employment in even the most remote Maine communities.
