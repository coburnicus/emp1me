		<h3 class="text-uppercase"><strong>Achieving Competitive Integrated Employment in Maine's Rural and Remote
			Communities: Strategies for Success (virtual training)</strong></h3>

			Rural communities are fundamentally different than bigger towns and cities â€” so, why would we try a one-size-fits-all approach to providing employment services? Maine's rural and remote communities are among the world's most remarkable, but they also introduce barriers to competitive integrated employment for their residents and those who support them. This session will provide participants with an in-depth opportunity to practice rural- specific strategies and techniques to overcome barriers to employment. Participants will learn how innovative and evidence-based approaches to using technology and creative job development and customization can lead to competitive integrated employment in even the most remote Maine communities.
